**Diabetes Detection Using Machine Learning: A Predictive Approach**

**Abstract**
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions worldwide, necessitating early detection for effective management. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on key health indicators. We implemented and compared multiple ML models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to assess their predictive accuracy. Using a dataset containing medical records, we applied data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model was deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive tool for real-time diabetes risk assessment.

**1. Introduction**
Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels, which, if left unmanaged, can lead to severe complications. Early diagnosis is critical in mitigating risks and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on laboratory tests, which can be time-consuming and costly. This study aims to leverage ML techniques to develop a predictive model that assists healthcare professionals in identifying diabetes risk based on key medical indicators (Smith et al., 2020).

**2. Related Work**
Several studies have explored the use of ML for diabetes prediction. Previous research has employed algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Deep Learning techniques (Brown & Johnson, 2021). However, challenges such as imbalanced datasets and feature selection remain crucial considerations. Studies have shown that ensemble models, such as Random Forest, tend to outperform traditional classification methods in medical diagnostics (Lee et al., 2022). This study contributes by comparing commonly used models and optimizing their performance using feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Dataset**
The dataset comprises patient health records, including attributes such as glucose level, BMI, insulin levels, and blood pressure. The data was sourced from publicly available medical repositories (Anderson et al., 2019).

**3.2 Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values using imputation techniques (Williams, 2020).
- Scaled and normalized features to improve model performance.
- Applied feature engineering to select the most relevant predictors.

**3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations.
- Identified important predictors using statistical techniques and feature importance scores (Chen et al., 2021).

**3.4 Model Development**
- Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest models (Miller & Zhang, 2021).
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).
- Applied hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

**3.5 Model Evaluation**
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score (Taylor et al., 2020).

**4. Results & Discussion**
The Random Forest model outperformed Logistic Regression with higher accuracy and better recall for diabetes detection. This aligns with findings from previous studies highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble models in medical diagnostics (Jones et al., 2023). The model provided reliable predictions, demonstrating the effectiveness of ML in identifying diabetes risk.

**5. Deployment with Streamlit**
To enhance accessibility, the best-performing model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input health data and receive real-time predictions. The application is accessible at: [https://diabetes-detection-2024.streamlit.app/](https://diabetes-detection-2024.streamlit.app/).

**6. Conclusion & Future Work**
This study demonstrates the potential of ML in diabetes prediction, providing an efficient and accessible tool for early diagnosis. Future work includes integrating additional features such as lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition to enhance model performance (Harris, 2023).
